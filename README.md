## Setting up a remote

To push these commits to GitHub, you can add a remote repository and push:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git

# Push the current branch to GitHub
git push -u origin work
```

Replace `<your-username>` and `<repo>` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.
